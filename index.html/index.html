                The zodiac is a diagram used by astrologers to represent the positions of the planets and stars. It is divided into twelve sections, each of which has its own name and symbol. The zodiac is used to try to calculate the influence of the planets, especially on someone's life.

            <h2>What It Means</h2>
            <p>
                Despite the nuances, the most fundamental principle of astrology centers on the 12 familiar star signs of the zodiac. Over the centuries, each sign has developed its own associations — including myths, animals, and colors — and its own characteristics. Every sign boasts an individual approach to life, complete with dynamic strengths and frustrating weaknesses.

            <h2>Sharing A Zodiac Sign</h2>
            <p>
                Zodiac signs can be extremely informative and insightful into someone's best and worst traits, and this can be extra valuable when you're dating someone with the same zodiac sign. Certain signs are super compatible, while others are majorly combustible. That's not to say that the relationship is guaranteed to either succeed or fail, but learning about how sign-on-sign dynamics play out can be very helpful as you navigate a new relationship or friendship.
